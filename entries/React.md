# React

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It was developed by Facebook and is now maintained by a community of developers.

React allows developers to create reusable UI components using a declarative syntax. It uses a virtual DOM to optimize performance and make updates to the UI fast and efficient.

React can be used in combination with other technologies such as [HTML](/wiki/HTML), [CSS](/wiki/CSS), and [JavaScript](/wiki/JavaScript) to build complex web applications. It can also be used with other libraries and frameworks such as [Redux](/wiki/Redux) for state management and [React Native](/wiki/React_Native) for building mobile apps.
